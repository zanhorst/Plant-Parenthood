# Planning process

I started my planning by drafting up my [wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/tbQPp7ZntOcDD3ZJOylJTp/Capstone-Project?node-id=0%3A1), to give myself an idea of what the site would look like. The wireframe was made with my upcoming v2 in mind, which will include comments and likes. Once that was finished, I created an [ERD](https://www.figma.com/file/MTln4HOhnxtDgFbQY0VfX1/Capstone-ERD?node-id=0%3A1), also with v2 in mind (because my v2 is what I envisioned the app to be when completed).
